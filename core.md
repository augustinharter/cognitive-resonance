## Cognitive Dissonance and Resonance

### What is Cognitive Dissonance
Wikipedia gives a good introduction so let me just copy it here:
"In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, and is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort."

The ways of resolving dissonances is an important topic on its own and we will come back to it later. For now let's focus on how dissonance emerges in the first place:

### How dissonance comes about
Since cognitive dissonance comes from contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values it comes from where you aquire those beliefs, ideas, or values, which is basicly your whole life: It might be as fundamental as your religious upbringing not being consistent with evolution or as trivial as expecting your favourite sports team to win and witnessing the opposite (though fans would probably argue that latter is the fundamental one). Also political views can be a big source of dissonance for example when they don't match with the demogrpahic statistics or with the proposed views of the other party.

### The case for Cognitive Resonance
Cognitive Resonance now at first climpse is simply the opppsite to dissonance: Your beliefs, values and ideas are aligned and support each other. But actually I don't think its just the trivial opposite, there exist several good reasons why it's helpful:
1. **Non-dissonant is not necessarily resonant**: Only because your believes and ideas are not contradictory doesn't mean they are resonant, they could simply be independent: Reasons why your favourite basketball team is the best probably don't contradict with your understanding of quantum physics.
2. **No dissonance should only be a subgoal**: Trying to achieve minimal cognitive dissonance is desireable but can also be achieved by not having believes and values at all or by living in your own bubble ignoring everything that is dissonant. The latter approach for reducing your cognitive dissonance and with that your comfort is the reason why biases and discrimination exists.
3. **Resonance should be the goal**: Maximizing resonance implies reducing dissonance as a subgoal but also motivates why we should stay curious and open minded. From the perspective of minimizing dissonance, curiosity is just a potential source of new dissonance, but with the perspective of maximizing resonance, curiosity holds the potential to integrate and resonate with even more parts of reality.

I personally find that the concept of cognitive resonance seems fundamental in understanding the human condition, or rather the "cognitive agent condition" to avoid anthropocentrism. That is why I want to share it here. But don't take my word for it but rather use your personal resonance and dissonance as the measure of truth. I'm curious about all your feedback be it motivated by agreement or contradiction.

### How to think of cognitive processes
For things to make sense we need good ways of thinking about them. Perspectives, analogies and connections which help our believes and ideas to resonate: Cognitive resonance/dissonance is a quite general concept which is useful in psychology to explain behavior, cognitive processes and biases. But I like it so much because it can also easily make sense from a neurological and technical perspective: Analog to Minsky's "society of mind" I am imagining the brain not as a singular centralized construct but as a collective of many neural systems that work together to make sense of the world. One system is the visual cortex responsible for processing what we perceive with our eyes. This visual system has itself many specialized subsystems for different important aspects of vision: One for example is resposible for detecting faces and making sense of facial expressions, while another is highly sensitive for movements in your peripheral vision (maybe you know latter system from your daily experience; sometimes the head moves instinctively towards a direction where we felt that something was happening without really knowing why and what happened). Many if not all systems work together, the vision system for example works together with systems responsible for movement to allow your hand eye coordination, or when your friend talks about a recent experience and you simultaniously imagine the situation in your head to further understand it. Your auditive system encoded the information but your visual system used it to simulate it in your head in order to see if it also makes sense visually. This probably makes it easier to imagine how your friend felt during the experience. If your systems work well together, in other words if you can achieve high cognitive resonance, you are using your cognitive processing capability more effectively.
